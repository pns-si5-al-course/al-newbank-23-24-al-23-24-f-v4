a markdown file, updated each Sunday at 8:00pm at the latest. This file should contain a log for each week, showing what was achieved, what is planned for the following week, what are the blockers and risks. Do not drill down in the content details, this is just a status report, but fill it consistently and honestly. In addition, indicate a Red/Yellow/Green flag showing your perception of where you think you are compared to where you think you should be. Each week, you should add the status to this file, on top, with the date, but leave previous week statuses below, do not replace, so you can see the full history in the blink of an eye.
